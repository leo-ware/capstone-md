We have a T which influences Y directly and via a set of mediating variables M. We want to measure what parts of the effect of T on Y are *direct* and which parts are *indirect*.

You get the controlled direct effect (CDE) by setting the mediators: p(Y | T, do(M)). This is not great because we are limited to measuring the effect only for specific values of M. Also, this doesn't give us a way to get the indirect effect.
