We've got a feature I, a treatment T, and an outcome O. I is correlated with O. We make some assumptions.
- I does not cause O
- I does cause T.
- I is randomly w/r/t other features.
Conclusion: T causes O.

Basically, even if we can't *assign* treatment, we might be able to *nudge* treatment (or find data about a nudge). We can still get a causal effect even though some people ignore the nudge.
