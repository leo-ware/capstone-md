- In this round, I will focus on learning about the design process in the visual arts and how this can be applied to software development/my capstone
- My intended approach is to work with my friends who are more interested in the visual design process/familiar with it, and work with them on a couple of small projects. I am going to go draw at a cafe with them to learn about the process.
- I will submit my drawings from cafe sessions and a short document of thoughts on the design process and what can be transferred.
