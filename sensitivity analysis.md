Question is how big would the unobserved confounders need to be to significantly alter our results. Typical result it to make some assumptions about how T, Y, observed covariates, unobserved covariates are related. Then, draw contour plots for what ATE/bias would look like under different levels of confounding.

We contextualize these results in a couple ways:
- how wrong would we have to be for the ATE to switch signs?
- how wrong would we be if we could not observe one of the covariates which we can observe now (Neal takes issue with this)

Everything is very blue sky

Neal recommends
- (Cinelli & Hazlett, 2020) for better stuff about contextualization
- (Veitch & Zaveri, 2020) for arbitrary functional forms
