Two graphs are Markov equivalent if they imply the same set of dependencies and independencies. Chains and forks are Markov equivalent (says Neal... Is this true?). Immoralities are special.

You get the skeleton of a graph by turning directed edges into undirected edges.

Two graphs are Markov equivalent iff they have the same skeleton and the same immoralities.
