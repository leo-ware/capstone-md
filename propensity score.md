The propensity score is the probability of receiving treatment given relevant covariates.

Propensity score encodes information about confounders in a really interesting way. If we condition on the true propensity score, then we can guarantee 

model that predicts treatment given covariates, used in a number of ways
- matching
- stratification
- conditional adjustment
- inverse probability of treatment weighting

generally super biased and not great, also pretty popular
