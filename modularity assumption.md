The *causal mechanism* of a variable $x_i$ is the probability distribution of $x_i$ given its parents $pa_i$. This is denoted $p(x_i | pa_i)$. The modularity assumption says that if we intervene on $x_j$, then the only causal mechanism that changes is $p(x_j | pa_j)$. 

Changing the causal mechanism for one variable does not change the causal mechanisms for the other. We can perform surgical interventions.
